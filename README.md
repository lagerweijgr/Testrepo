# My project 
 
This project is a subset of my work on analysing sequential data. This is work in progress

## Usage 
A whole sequential dataset can be hard to analyze. In this project I have wrote some code on clustering data based 
the sequential data based on the distance between snipes (SNPs). I have developed some functions to make clusters and analyse and visualize subclusters. 
The user can download the folders on this repository and start using it. The whole analysis can be performed by running the main script "RunDAta.R". 
The data can be found in the folder "data" and there are three example files that can be analyzed. 

## Project structure 
The project structure distinguishes three kinds of folders:
- data 
- results
- docs
